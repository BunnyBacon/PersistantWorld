== Persistant World

The ruby on rails project that goes along with the www.PersistantWorld.com website.

=====================================
              The Plan
=====================================
  Before I begin I would like to make it clear that this project is meant to be a culmination of my rails knowledge and a testing platform for the things that I would like know and learn about. At the same time, I did not wish to do the exact same thing that every other programmer in my position ends up doing... a blog. Granted, there is nothing wrong with that; however, I don't like to read blogs nor would I expect anyone else to want to read mine, so I decided to make a website about something that other people would be interested in and I would love to be a part of and create.
  I am a gamer. A hardcore gamer, and I could write essay after essay, blog after blog, about them but that doesnt appeal to me. Nor would posting the news about the video gaming industry help me at all. I am however, also a tabletop gamer, and I decided that I would love to host and promote tabletop games in a way that would be interesting for those who are both involved and just casual readers.
  And so we come to the heart of the issue, the "Persistant world". Persistant because the world, and game that uses it, never ceases. Players can join and leave at any time and every action that they do affects the evolution of that world. To allow this, the world needs to be free and editable; however, clearly defined and managed. So I decided on a series of things that will keep the game and its world clear of debris, and at the same time, promote its growth.

  1. The site will be headed by a dashboard-like landing page. Players will sign up and create a character and profile, meet/add friends and hopefully more.
  2. The world itself will be managed by a wiki. Here, GMs and Administrators can add new content and expand the world as they see fit. While I am on this subject, GMs or Game Masters, are different then Administrators. Game masters are players who have proven themselves to understand the world as a whole and, after being cleared by one of the Admins, are able to add and edit content on the wiki and the forums (which will be explained below). Administrators are people who will be hand selected by me with much more control over the players and the GMs for that matter. In a sense they can alter anything that anyone does regarding the game, the wiki, and the forums. Then there is me, who on the forums will be listed as "BunnyBacon", who will have control over the database; that way, in case a GM or Admin go haywire, I can revert to a past save of the database. The database will be saved nightly, with older saves being deleted after 1 week of age (to cut down on costs >_>).
  3. The game will be handled almost entirely on the Forums and will be controlled by GMs. These forums will be broken up into a multitude of sections that allow players to join in the places that they wish and make a difference in that section. All players can add to the forums, and the point is to be a part of the world as a whole. Large scale events that effect the story of the world will be added to the wiki to become part of the history of the world as a whole. All players should strive to be of this calibre, those that do will be given Epic status. Their posts will be highlighted in gold so that other players will wish to interact with them.

  These are just the core concepts of the Persistant World site, and more will be added to it as it goes along. For now these are the "User stories" though pretty large in scale. I do want to state, for anyone watching or following this project that I am not going to be doing TDD. I am still in the process of learning Cucumber, and I am the type of programmer who doesnt start until I know exactly what its going to do and look like.
