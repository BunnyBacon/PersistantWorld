<h2><u>Latest News</u></h2><br />
<p>While we are still in development, the site is coming along nicely. I would like to stress that to our visitors. Not all the things that we have planned, have been implemented yet. So, if there is something that you expect to be on a site like this, or any site for that matter, it is probably in the plans somewhere, but have yet to be added or constructed. Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>With that, welcome to the persistent world! Think of this website as a game. A ever-evolving and always persisting simulation of the tabletop DnD experience. I am sure that youve seen or heard of "Play-by-post" games or "Role-Playing". And yes, this site does do both of those; however, it is much more than that. The main reason that is, is because of the setting, or the "world" that the game resides in. The setting may seem pretty standard to begin with; however, as the many different player-run games progress, the world will grow, and change. Each action that the players take could effect the world as a whole. A butterfly effect that cascades forever and could potentially effect every other player after it.</p>
<p>For example, in one game, a large dragon emerges from the caves in the north, laying waste to a village and then moving further southeast to terrorize a larger settlement. But, there it is met by some heroes, each one a user on this site, and it is defeated. However, this battle was hard fought and a large portion of the town was destroyed. If other people on the site read that game and enjoy it, they can vote to have that story become "epic". After enough votes that game becomes written into the world itself meaning that the town may or may not exist. Or even, it might be renovated, or renamed after one of the heroes. The body of the dragon could still be present. The dragons cave is now empty and ready to be explored. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Here, the world is literally what you make of it. The effort that you put into your writing is well rewarded. The time you put into your character development has value. And, if its well done, people will read it more and more and want to play with you, or in your games in hopes that they too can become epic and immortalized in the world's history. To get started, click the <%= link_to "Active Games", "/forums" %> and find a game, or make one of your own. I look forward to reading about youre experiences. Enjoy.</p>
